Version-
1.2
Made for GB Studio 4.1.2
Released 6/3/2024

Description-
Shmup Reloaded is an engine plugin that completely replaces the Shoot 'Em Up scene type. It includes the following features:
-Full diagonal 8 way movement for the player with autoscrolling in all 4 directions
-Appropriate animation controller for the player
-Consistent 8px by 8px collisions for the player regardless of their collision box, allowing the player to use a smaller collision box for a better feeling shmup
-All triggers activate when they are scrolled onto the screen rather than when the player touches them (checked at the top of the screen for horizontal scrolling and the left of the screen for vertical scrolling)
-Better collision for higher movement speeds
Please note that background collision is not fully implemented. It can be used to block off a portion of the screen for a HUD, but should not be used as obstacles for the player. In the interest of keeping the plugin simple to use, I don't plan on fully implementing it.
